# Know-Your-Neighbourhood
We have to develop an API for the know your neighbourhood application which provides information about the nearby stores in a given locality. We have to make use of an existing API to provide register and login functionalities for the users. (Facebook, Google Login API) 


## Project Background
Customers can login using existing API and it will fetch their basic information such as name and email from the API, then that information will be used to register or login the user in the know your neighbourhood portal. By making use of existing API user will save a lot of time and more users will be willing to register on the portal as the registration/login process will be simplified.

As most of the users now-a-days use many social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and also Google. So, we can make use of the particular API and fetch their required information from either of these sites so that the user does not have to enter any details manually and the registration/login process becomes seamless. 

In this case the user will have to provide the username and password of the existing API such as Google, Facebook or Twitter and login with that API then we will get the required details from that particular API and the user will be Registered/ Logged In.

In total User will be able to register/ login on the portal using an existing API and the portal will consist of the following key pages:
* Home Page
* Registration Page
* Login Page with API link
* Contact us Page
* About us Page
* Terms and Conditions Page


## Project Evidences
So given below are the wireframes for the know your neighbourhood application, In the registration page the user can register on the website using the normal method where he enters his email and password as well as he can use Facebook API for registering on the portal. Once the user is registered, he will be taken to the Dashboard where he could update his basic details and access the portal and in case of registration using Facebook API his basic details and profile picture will be fetched from Facebooks server.

Same goes for Login as the user can Login by typing his credentials manually as well as he can login using the Facebook API once logged in successfully both the users will be taken to the dashboard where they can access the portal furthermore.
